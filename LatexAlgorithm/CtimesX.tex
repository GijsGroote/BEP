    %INPUT
    % R is the index of the measured pixel

    % estimate the value of the pixel from the tensor network of X
    estimatedOutput = reshape(X1(R1,:,:),1,d)*reshape(X2(R2,:,:),d,1);
    % The reshaping is needed to get the right dimensions for multipling
    % (X1 and X2 need to be 2d, while they are 1x1xd)
